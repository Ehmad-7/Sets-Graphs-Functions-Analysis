Sets, Graphs, and Functions Analysis

This repository contains C++ implementations of three distinct problems that explore key concepts in Discrete Structures, including sets, graphs, and functions. The solutions leverage object-oriented programming principles, modular design, and efficient algorithms.

Overview
This project demonstrates the analysis and manipulation of discrete structures through the following tasks:

Graph Path Analysis

Calculate paths of specific lengths between vertices in a graph.
Supports both directed and undirected graphs.
Set and Relation Operations

Perform basic set operations and analyze relations for reflexivity, symmetry, and anti-symmetry.
Function Analysis

Analyze functions between sets to determine properties like "into," "onto," invertibility, and composition.

Features
-Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for modular and reusable code.
-Data Structures and Algorithm.
-Menu-driven interfaces for user interaction.
-Thorough input validation and error handling.
-Dynamic memory management to ensure efficient resource usage.
-Commented code for clarity and maintainability.
